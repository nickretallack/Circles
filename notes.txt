Todo:
    This is going to need private messages.  Those will exist within circles too.
    List users in a circle and give them member pages
    Change your name in a circle (and other settings in the future)
    Mark people as trusted when they accept each other's invitations
    Don't let people re-use the same invitation
    Mark invitations as clicked on once that happens
    
Done:
    Invitations
        Handle the case where you're logged in when you receive one?  Is this different?  Nah.
    Make it so when you log in it takes you back to the previous page if there was one
        Put the referer in a hidden field in the login form






Okay, invitations.  You send an email with a link in it.  The link should just contain a single hash.  All the relevant info would be in the database.

Invitation:
    uid
    circle_id
    inviter_id - person who invited you.  Automatically establishes trust with this user

You might have an account already, or not.  Hm.  I need to handle logins now.
Also figure out email.



Nice to Have:
    Expanding textareas
    SwfUpload / multi-upload support
