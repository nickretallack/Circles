This is going to need private messages.  Those will exist within circles too.


Okay, invitations.  You send an email with a link in it.  The link should just contain a single hash.  All the relevant info would be in the database.

Invitation:
    uid
    circle_id
    inviter_id - person who invited you.  Automatically establishes trust with this user

You might have an account already, or not.  Hm.  I need to handle logins now.
Also figure out email.
