This is a minimal implementation of a social network.  It is currently running at http://circles.ws.

It lacks one important feature before it can be really useful: email notifications.  I will try to get these in soon so people can make better use of it.

The majority of the code exists in one big file.  This is because it was written quickly as an experiment.  I encountered some difficulties with SQLAlchemy when I attempted to split it up, so I've put friendly visual dividers in the comments instead.
